- **Phase 1**: 4 weeks (Weeks 3-6) ✅ Matches roadmap
- **Review milestones**: Weekly + final ✅ Appropriate

### 4. Resource Alignment

#### Team Allocation Check
| Role | Roadmap (Phase 1) | Worker Plan | Review Plan | Status |
|------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Backend Dev | 2 FTE | 2 developers | Tech lead oversight | ✅ |
| Frontend Dev | 2 FTE | 2 developers | Covered | ✅ |
| QA | 0.5 FTE | Testing tasks | QA lead 3hr/week | ✅ |
| Security | (Not specified) | Security tests | Security reviewer | ⚠️ Note |

**Note**: Security reviewer added in review plan - good addition not in original roadmap.

### 5. Quality Standards Alignment

#### Testing Coverage Requirements
- **SPEC NFR**: "Test Coverage: >85% overall, >95% critical paths"
- **Worker Plan**: "coverage_target: 85" + ">95% for auth code"
- **Review Plan**: ">85% overall, >95% for auth code"
- **Status**: ✅ Perfectly aligned

#### Performance Requirements
- **SPEC**: "API Response: <200ms (99th percentile)"
- **Worker Plan**: "<500ms" for task operations
- **Review Plan**: "GET <100ms, POST/PUT <200ms average"
- **Status**: ✅ Review plan more stringent (good)

### 6. Risk Alignment

#### Risk Identification Consistency
| Risk | SPEC | Roadmap | Phase Plan | Mitigation Aligned? |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Performance at scale | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Yes |
| Integration complexity | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Yes |
| Authentication security | (Implied) | - | ✓ | ✅ Added appropriately |

### 7. Deliverable Alignment

#### Phase 1 Deliverables Trace
| Deliverable | Worker Plan | Review Criteria | Stakeholder Value |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Auth system | ✓ Detailed | ✓ Security focus | ✅ Enables all features |
| Task CRUD | ✓ Complete | ✓ API standards | ✅ Core business value |
| Web UI | ✓ Specified | ✓ Accessibility | ✅ User adoption |
| API docs | ✓ Listed | ✓ Completeness | ✅ Integration ready |

## Validation Findings

### Strengths (Excellent Alignment)
1. **Requirements Traceability**: Every SPEC requirement mapped to phases
2. **Technical Stack**: 100% consistency across all documents  
3. **Quality Standards**: Testing and performance targets consistent
4. **Progressive Elaboration**: Details increase appropriately by document level

### Minor Observations
1. **Security Review**: Review plan adds security reviewer (good addition, update roadmap)
2. **Performance Targets**: Review plan more aggressive than worker plan (document this)
3. **Buffer Time**: Phase has 3-day buffer in roadmap, not explicit in plans

### Recommendations
1. **Update Roadmap**: Add security reviewer role to resource plan
2. **Clarify Buffers**: Make buffer time explicit in phase plans
3. **Document Decisions**: Note why review performance targets are stricter

## Cross-Functional Dependencies

### Validated Dependencies
- ✅ Phase 0 completion required (all docs agree)
- ✅ Database provisioning needed (consistently mentioned)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline setup (prerequisite confirmed)

### API Contract Criticality
All documents emphasize early API design:
- SPEC: "Interface changes" are major risk
- Roadmap: Critical path includes auth system  
- Worker Plan: API documentation deliverable
- Review Plan: API design review in week 3

**Validation**: ✅ Strong alignment on API-first approach

## Success Criteria Correlation

### Business → Technical Mapping
| Business Goal (SPEC) | Technical Implementation (Plans) | Measurable? |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| 40% efficiency gain | Fast task creation (<30s) | ✅ Yes |
| Tool consolidation | Single integrated system | ✅ Yes |
| Real-time visibility | (Deferred to Phase 2) | ✅ Appropriate |

## Version Compatibility Matrix

| Document | Version | Date | Compatible With Others? |
|----------|---------|------|------------------------|
| SPEC | 1.0.0 | 2024-01-15 | ✅ Baseline |
| Roadmap | 1.0.0 | 2024-01-18 | ✅ Yes |
| Worker Plan | 1.0.0 | 2024-01-20 | ✅ Yes |
| Review Plan | 1.0.0 | 2024-01-20 | ✅ Yes |
