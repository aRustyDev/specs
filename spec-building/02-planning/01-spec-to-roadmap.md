## Overview
This process transforms a validated specification into an actionable roadmap with well-defined phases. The roadmap serves as the bridge between "what to build" (spec) and "how to build it" (phase plans).

## Prerequisites

### Required Inputs
- Quality-validated SPEC.md (score ≥90/100)
- Modular spec files in spec/ directory
- Resource availability information
- Timeline constraints
- Business priorities

### Required Templates
- `../templates/roadmap-template.md`
- `../templates/phase-definition.md`
- `../templates/alignment-validation.md`

## Process Overview

The roadmap generation consists of:
1. Dependency analysis (2-3 hours)
2. Phase identification (2-3 hours)
3. Sequencing and optimization (1-2 hours)
4. Milestone definition (1-2 hours)
5. Validation and documentation (1-2 hours)

**Total time**: 7-12 hours

## Phase 1: Dependency Analysis

### 1.1 Component Dependency Mapping

Create a dependency graph from the spec:

```markdown
## Component Dependencies

### Core Components
- Authentication Service
  - Dependencies: Database, Cache
  - Dependents: All user-facing services
  
- Database Layer
  - Dependencies: None (foundational)
  - Dependents: All services
  
- API Gateway
  - Dependencies: Authentication, Rate Limiter
  - Dependents: External clients
```

### 1.2 Feature Dependencies

Map feature relationships:

```markdown
## Feature Dependencies

### Must Have Features
1. User Registration
   - Depends on: Database, Email Service
   - Enables: User Authentication, Profile Management

2. User Authentication  
   - Depends on: User Registration, Session Management
   - Enables: All authenticated features
```

### 1.3 Technical Dependencies

Identify technical prerequisites:

```markdown
## Technical Prerequisites

### Infrastructure
- Cloud account setup
- CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring infrastructure

### Integrations
- Payment gateway account
- Email service provider
- SMS gateway (if applicable)
```

### 1.4 Dependency Visualization

Create visual dependency graph:
```
Foundation Layer
├── Database Setup
├── Infrastructure Config
└── Core Libraries

Service Layer (depends on Foundation)
├── Auth Service
├── User Service
└── Notification Service

API Layer (depends on Services)
├── REST API
├── GraphQL API
└── Webhook Handlers

Client Layer (depends on API)
├── Web Application
├── Mobile Apps
└── Admin Portal
```

## Phase 2: Phase Identification

### 2.1 Natural Phase Boundaries

Identify logical groupings based on:

**Delivery Value**
- What can provide value independently?
- What represents a meaningful milestone?
- What could be released to users?

**Technical Coherence**
- What components work together?
- What shares similar complexity?
- What uses similar technologies?

**Resource Optimization**
- What can the same team build?
- What parallelization is possible?
- What minimizes context switching?

### 2.2 Phase Sizing Guidelines

Target phase characteristics:
- **Duration**: 2-4 weeks per phase
- **Scope**: 3-7 major features/components
- **Team Size**: 2-5 developers
- **Complexity**: Balanced mix
- **Risk**: Distributed across phases

### 2.3 Phase Definition Process

For each identified phase:

```markdown
## Phase X: [Phase Name]

### Objectives
- Primary: [Main deliverable]
- Secondary: [Supporting deliverables]

### Scope
#### Included
- Component A (full implementation)
- Component B (basic version)
- Integration with X

#### Excluded  
- Component C (next phase)
- Advanced features of B
- Performance optimization

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All included components functional
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Performance baseline met

### Dependencies
- Prerequisites: Phase X, Y
- Enables: Phase Z

### Estimated Effort
- Development: X weeks
- Testing: Y weeks
- Total: Z weeks
```

### 2.4 Phase Validation

Check each phase for:
- **Independence**: Can it be developed separately?
- **Completeness**: Does it deliver working functionality?
- **Testability**: Can it be validated independently?
- **Value**: Does it provide business/technical value?

## Phase 3: Sequencing and Optimization

### 3.1 Sequencing Strategies

**Dependency-Driven Sequencing**
1. Map critical path through dependencies
2. Identify phases that can run in parallel
3. Optimize for minimum total duration

**Risk-Driven Sequencing**
1. Tackle highest risk items early
2. Build proof of concepts first
3. Leave well-understood work for later

**Value-Driven Sequencing**
1. Deliver user value quickly
2. Enable revenue generation early
3. Build engagement features progressively

### 3.2 Optimization Techniques

**Parallelization Opportunities**
```markdown
Parallel Track 1: Backend Services
- Phase 1: Database & Core Services
- Phase 3: API Development
- Phase 5: Performance Optimization

Parallel Track 2: Frontend Development
- Phase 2: UI Framework Setup
- Phase 4: Feature Implementation
- Phase 6: Polish & Optimization
```

**Resource Balancing**
- Distribute specialist needs across phases
- Balance workload across team
- Avoid resource conflicts

### 3.3 Timeline Creation

Build realistic timeline with buffers:

```markdown
## Implementation Timeline

### Q1 2024
- Weeks 1-3: Phase 1 - Foundation (Critical Path)
- Weeks 4-6: Phase 2 - Core Services
- Weeks 7-9: Phase 3 - Basic Features
- Weeks 10-12: Integration & Testing Buffer

### Q2 2024
- Weeks 13-15: Phase 4 - Advanced Features
- Weeks 16-18: Phase 5 - Integrations
- Weeks 19-21: Phase 6 - Performance
- Weeks 22-24: Launch Preparation
```

## Phase 4: Milestone Definition

### 4.1 Milestone Types

**Technical Milestones**

- [ ] Stakeholder approval

### Validation Method
- How to verify completion
- Who validates
- What evidence required

### Go/No-Go Criteria

- Escalation process
```

### 4.3 Milestone Schedule

Map milestones to timeline:

| Week | Phase | Milestone | Type | Critical Path |
|------|-------|-----------|------|---------------|
| 3 | 1 | Infrastructure Ready | Technical | Yes |
| 6 | 2 | Core Services Live | Technical | Yes |
| 9 | 3 | MVP Features Complete | Business | Yes |
| 12 | - | Beta Launch Ready | Business | No |
| 15 | 4 | Feature Complete | Business | No |
| 18 | 5 | Integrations Done | Technical | No |
| 21 | 6 | Performance Validated | Quality | Yes |
| 24 | - | Production Launch | Business | Yes |

## Phase 5: Validation and Documentation

### 5.1 Roadmap Validation

- [ ] All spec requirements mapped to phases
- [ ] No orphaned requirements
- [ ] Dependencies satisfied
- [ ] Resources allocated

**Feasibility Check**
- [ ] Timeline realistic
- [ ] Resource requirements met
- [ ] Technical approach sound
- [ ] Risk mitigation adequate

**Alignment Check**
- [ ] Business priorities reflected
- [ ] Technical constraints respected
- [ ] Team capabilities matched
- [ ] Stakeholder expectations met

### 5.2 Risk Assessment

Document risks by phase:

```markdown
## Phase Risk Analysis

### Phase 1 Risks
- Risk: Cloud provider delays
  - Impact: High (blocks everything)
  - Mitigation: Early account setup, backup provider

### Phase 2 Risks  
- Risk: Database scaling issues
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Load testing, scaling plan
```

### 5.3 Final Roadmap Document

Generate ROADMAP.md using template:

```markdown
# Project Roadmap

## Executive Summary
[2-3 paragraphs summarizing approach, timeline, and key milestones]

## Phase Overview
[Table summarizing all phases with duration and key deliverables]

## Detailed Phase Plans
[Detailed description of each phase using phase template]

## Timeline
[Visual timeline with milestones and dependencies]

## Resource Plan
[Team allocation by phase]

## Risk Management
[Consolidated risk register with mitigations]

## Success Metrics
[How we measure roadmap execution success]
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Big Bang Phases**: Phases too large to deliver incrementally
2. **Technical-Only Focus**: Ignoring business value delivery
3. **Over-Optimization**: Perfect efficiency vs practical delivery
4. **Rigid Sequencing**: No flexibility for discoveries
5. **Resource Conflicts**: Same people needed everywhere

## Quality Gates

Before finalizing roadmap:
- [ ] All phases sized appropriately (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Dependencies clearly mapped and satisfied
- [ ] Milestones have clear success criteria
- [ ] Resources realistically allocated
- [ ] Risks identified with mitigations
- [ ] Stakeholder alignment confirmed

## Next Steps

With completed roadmap:
1. Review with all stakeholders
2. Get formal approval
3. Create phase plans using `3-roadmap-to-phase-plan.md`
4. Set up tracking mechanisms
5. Begin Phase 1 execution

## Continuous Improvement

Track and improve:
- Estimation accuracy
- Phase completion rates
- Milestone achievement
- Risk prediction accuracy
- Resource utilization

Use metrics to refine future roadmaps.
