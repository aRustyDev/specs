## Execution Guides

### 1. [Phase Execution Guide](01-phase-execution-guide.md)
**Purpose**: Standard operating procedures for running phases

**Key Topics**:
- Daily execution rhythm
- Work package management
- Progress tracking
- Communication patterns
- Quality checkpoints

**When to use**: At the start of each phase

### 2. [Change Management](02-change-management.md)
**Purpose**: Control scope and requirement changes

**Change Categories**:
- **Minor**: No impact on timeline/budget
- **Moderate**: Single phase impact
- **Major**: Multi-phase or architecture impact

**Process**:
1. Document change request
2. Assess impact
3. Get approval
4. Update plans
5. Communicate change

### 3. [Failure Recovery](03-failure-recovery.md)
**Purpose**: Get back on track when things go wrong

**Common Failures**:
- Technical blockers
- Resource unavailability
- Requirement misunderstanding
- Integration issues
- Performance problems

**Recovery Process**:
1. Assess situation
2. Identify root cause
3. Develop options
4. Execute recovery
5. Prevent recurrence

## Daily Execution Checklist

### Morning Standup

## Communication Protocols

### Status Reporting
**Daily**: Team standup (15 min)
**Weekly**: Stakeholder update
**Phase End**: Comprehensive review

### Issue Escalation
1. **Level 1**: Team lead (same day)
2. **Level 2**: Project manager (within 24h)
3. **Level 3**: Steering committee (within 48h)

### Change Communication
- All changes logged in change register
- Approved changes communicated within 24h
- Plan updates distributed within 48h

## Quality Gates
