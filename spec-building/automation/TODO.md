- [x] Implement proper error handling
- [x] Add --help with examples to all scripts
- [x] Create validate-all.py orchestrator
- [x] Add multiple output formats (JSON, markdown)
- [x] Implement --strict and --quiet modes for CI/CD

## üìã Phase 2: Advanced Features (4-6 days)

### Configuration File Support
- [ ] Add `--config` option to all scripts

  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.md
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ standard/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spec.md
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outcome-definition.md
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ acceptance-scenarios.md
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ enterprise/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (additional templates)
  ```
- [ ] Support custom template directories
- [ ] Template variable substitution (without Jinja2 initially)

### Validation Rule Engine
- [ ] Create extensible validation rule system

- [ ] Fix suggestions for common issues

### Enhanced Reporting
- [ ] HTML report generation with charts

## üìä Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure improvement success:
- Average spec quality score improvement
- Time to create spec (reduced by X%)
- First-time approval rate (increased by X%)
- User satisfaction scores
- Adoption rate across teams

## üóìÔ∏è Rough Timeline

- **Phase 2**: 4-6 days of focused work
- **Phase 3**: 5-7 days of focused work
- **Ongoing**: Maintenance and minor improvements

Total estimated effort: 10-15 days

## üìù Notes

- Prioritize based on user feedback
- Keep backward compatibility when possible
- Consider creating a spec-tools package
- Engage with community for feature requests
- Regular releases with semantic versioning
