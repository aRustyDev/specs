# Outcome Definition Template

## Instructions
Replace all examples with your project-specific outcomes. Be as specific and measurable as possible.

## Business Outcomes

### Primary Business Goal
**What business problem are we solving?**
[Example: Reduce customer support tickets by 40% by providing self-service capabilities]

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Current State | Target State | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| [Example: Support tickets/month] | [1000] | [600] | [Helpdesk system] |
| [Metric 2] | [Current] | [Target] | [How measured] |
| [Metric 3] | [Current] | [Target] | [How measured] |

### Business Value
**Quantify the value of achieving these outcomes:**
- Cost savings: [Example: $50k/month in support costs]
- Revenue increase: [Example: 20% more upgrades due to better UX]
- Efficiency gains: [Example: 3 FTE equivalent time saved]
- Risk reduction: [Example: 90% fewer security incidents]

### Timeline Criticality
**Why now? What happens if we delay?**
[Example: Competitor launching similar feature in Q3, need market presence by Q2]

## User Outcomes

### User Personas
For each key user type:

**Persona 1: [Name/Role]**
- Current pain points: [What frustrates them today]
- Desired outcome: [What they want to achieve]
- Success looks like: [Specific description]
- Failure looks like: [What to avoid]

**Persona 2: [Name/Role]**
- Current pain points:
- Desired outcome:
- Success looks like:
- Failure looks like:

### User Journey Outcomes
**Before State → After State**

| Journey | Current State | Desired State | Success Criteria |
|---------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| [Example: Onboarding] | [Takes 30 mins, 50% drop] | [Takes 5 mins, 90% complete] | [Time tracked, completion rate] |
| [Journey 2] | [Current] | [Desired] | [How measured] |

### User Satisfaction Metrics
- Target NPS score: [Example: >50]
- Target satisfaction: [Example: 4.5/5 stars]
- Target adoption rate: [Example: 80% active users]
- Target retention: [Example: <5% monthly churn]

## Technical Outcomes

### System Capabilities
**What will the system be able to do that it can't today?**

| Capability | Current Limit | Target Capability | Business Impact |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| [Example: Concurrent users] | [100] | [10,000] | [Support growth] |
| [Example: API response time] | [2s] | [200ms] | [Better UX] |
| [Capability 3] | [Current] | [Target] | [Why it matters] |

### Technical Debt Reduction
**What problems will be solved?**
- [Example: Eliminate manual deployment process]
- [Example: Remove dependency on deprecated library]
- [Example: Consolidate 3 databases into 1]

### Future Enablement
**What does this enable us to do next?**
- [Example: Enables mobile app development]
- [Example: Allows third-party integrations]
- [Example: Supports international expansion]

## Quality Outcomes

### Reliability
- Target uptime: [Example: 99.95%]
- Error budget: [Example: 21 minutes/month]
- Recovery time: [Example: <5 minutes]

### Performance  
- Page load time: [Example: <2s for 95th percentile]
- API latency: [Example: <200ms for 99th percentile]
- Throughput: [Example: 1000 requests/second]

### Security
- Compliance achieved: [Example: SOC2, GDPR]
- Security posture: [Example: OWASP Top 10 addressed]
- Incident response: [Example: <1 hour detection]

### Maintainability
- Code coverage: [Example: >90%]
- Documentation coverage: [Example: 100% public APIs]
- Onboarding time: [Example: New dev productive in 1 week]

## Outcome Prioritization

Rank outcomes by criticality (1-10):

| Outcome | Criticality | Rationale |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| [Most critical outcome] | 10 | [Why this is essential] |
| [Second outcome] | 8 | [Why this matters] |
| [Third outcome] | 6 | [Why this is important] |

## Outcome Dependencies

Map relationships between outcomes:

```
Business Outcome A
  └── Requires Technical Outcome B
      └── Requires Quality Outcome C
          └── Enables User Outcome D
```

## Anti-Outcomes

**What are we explicitly NOT trying to achieve?**
- NOT trying to: [Example: Build a general-purpose platform]
- NOT solving for: [Example: Real-time collaboration]
- NOT optimizing for: [Example: Minimal cost over quality]

## Validation Questions

Before finalizing, answer:
1. Can we measure every outcome objectively?
2. Do outcomes conflict with each other?
3. Are outcomes achievable with known constraints?
4. Will stakeholders agree these are the right outcomes?
5. What outcomes might we be missing?
