# Spec Building Quick Reference Checklist

## Pre-Flight Checklist
- [ ] Project concept defined
- [ ] Stakeholders identified
- [ ] Time allocated (10-15 hours)
- [ ] Templates accessible

## Phase 1: Discovery (2-4h)
- [ ] Select project context type
- [ ] Load appropriate requirements template
- [ ] Gather initial requirements
- [ ] Create user stories
- [ ] Define quality criteria
- [ ] Identify scope boundaries
- [ ] **GATE**: 80% requirements captured, user confirms vision

## Phase 2: Analysis (1-2h)
- [ ] Decompose compound requirements
- [ ] Apply MoSCoW prioritization
- [ ] Define acceptance criteria
- [ ] Create traceability matrix
- [ ] Resolve ambiguities
- [ ] **GATE**: All requirements atomic, priorities assigned

## Phase 3: Research (2-3h parallel)
- [ ] Plan research areas
- [ ] Deploy subagents with:
  - [ ] Architecture research (60m)
  - [ ] Technology stack research (45m)
  - [ ] Tools/ecosystem research (45m)
  - [ ] Deployment research (30m)
- [ ] Compile decision matrices
- [ ] **GATE**: 3+ options evaluated, recommendations ready

## Phase 4: Design (2-3h)
- [ ] Select architecture pattern
- [ ] Define components
- [ ] Specify interfaces
- [ ] Finalize tech stack
- [ ] Design for non-functionals
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams
- [ ] **GATE**: Components defined, stack finalized

## Phase 5: Validation (1-2h)
- [ ] Conduct decision session using template
- [ ] Validate scenarios
- [ ] Check completeness
- [ ] Detect ambiguities
- [ ] Get stakeholder approval
- [ ] **GATE**: All decisions documented, approved

## Phase 6: Decomposition (1-2h)
- [ ] Create modular spec files
- [ ] Build implementation roadmap
- [ ] Define extension points
- [ ] Plan documentation approach
- [ ] **GATE**: Modular structure complete, roadmap defined

## Quality Checks
- [ ] Time boxes respected
- [ ] Gates properly evaluated
- [ ] Decisions documented with rationale
- [ ] Research bounded and focused
- [ ] Single validation pass completed
- [ ] Output structure follows standard

## Common Issues Checklist
- [ ] Avoided analysis paralysis
- [ ] Didn't over-engineer simple project
- [ ] Respected "good enough" threshold
- [ ] Limited validation iterations
- [ ] Prevented scope creep
- [ ] Made timely decisions

## Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] SPEC.md created
- [ ] Component specs modularized
- [ ] Decision records documented
- [ ] Research findings compiled
- [ ] Roadmap defined
- [ ] All in standard structure
