# Project Context Templates

## Overview
Different project types have different requirements. This framework provides context-specific requirement sets that are loaded based on project type.

## Core Requirements (Always Applied)

### Functional Requirements
- Primary use cases and user stories
- Core business logic and rules
- Data models and structures
- Key workflows and processes

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance targets (response time, throughput)
- Security requirements (authentication, authorization)
- Scalability needs (user count, data volume)
- Reliability targets (uptime, error rates)

### Quality Requirements
- Code quality standards
- Testing requirements (unit, integration, e2e)
- Documentation standards
- Maintenance considerations

## Context Templates

### 6. Mobile Application Context

**Additional Requirements:**
- Platform targets (iOS/Android/both)
- Device compatibility matrix
- Offline functionality
- Push notification requirements
- App store requirements
- Deep linking support

**CI/CD Requirements:**
- App signing and certificates
- Beta distribution (TestFlight/Play Console)
- App store deployment
- Over-the-air updates
- Crash reporting

**Testing Requirements:**
- Device testing matrix
- UI automation testing
- Performance profiling
- Battery usage testing
- Network condition testing

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Project Type Selection
During the Discovery phase, identify the project type:
```
What type of project is this?
1. Web Application
2. Library/Package
3. CLI Tool
4. Data Pipeline
5. Microservice
6. Mobile Application
7. Other (specify)
```

### 2. Requirement Loading
Based on selection, load:
- Core requirements (always)
- Context-specific requirements
- Any custom requirements specified by user

### 3. Customization
Allow users to:
- Exclude irrelevant requirements
- Add project-specific requirements
- Modify requirement priorities

### 4. Validation
Ensure:
- No conflicting requirements
- All dependencies identified
- Feasibility confirmed

## Minimal Project Template

For projects that don't fit standard categories:

**Basic Requirements Only:**
- Core functionality definition
- Basic testing approach
- Minimal documentation
- Simple deployment method

**Optional Additions:**
- Selected requirements from other contexts
- Custom requirements as needed

## Context Switching

Projects may evolve from one type to another (e.g., CLI tool â†’ Web service). When this happens:

1. Retain applicable requirements
2. Add new context requirements
3. Resolve any conflicts
4. Update project roadmap

## Best Practices

1. **Start Minimal**: Begin with core requirements, add context-specific ones only when confirmed needed
2. **Avoid Over-Specification**: Not every project needs every requirement
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Requirements can be added during later phases
4. **User Confirmation**: Always validate context selection with user
5. **Document Exclusions**: Explicitly note what's NOT in scope
