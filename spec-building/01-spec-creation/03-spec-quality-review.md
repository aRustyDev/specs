## Overview
This process ensures that specifications meet the highest quality standards before proceeding to roadmap creation. A robust spec is the foundation for all downstream work, so this review process is critical for project success.

## Prerequisites

### Required Inputs
- Completed SPEC.md file
- All modular spec files in spec/ directory
- Completed templates from Phase 0 of spec creation
- At least 2 reviewers (technical and business perspective)

### Required Templates
- `../templates/spec-quality-rubric.md` - Scoring framework
- `../templates/spec-improvement-checklist.md` - Improvement tracking
- `../templates/alignment-validation.md` - Consistency checks

## Process Overview

The spec review process consists of:
1. Initial quality assessment (2-3 hours)
2. Gap analysis and prioritization (1-2 hours)
3. Improvement implementation (4-8 hours)
4. Final validation (1-2 hours)
5. Sign-off and documentation (1 hour)

**Total time**: 9-16 hours depending on spec complexity and initial quality

## Phase 1: Initial Quality Assessment

### 1.1 Automated Validation
First, run automated checks:

```bash
# Check for completeness
grep -r "TODO\|TBD\|FIXME\|XXX" .spec/ SPEC.md

# Verify cross-references
python scripts/validate-spec-links.py

# Check structure compliance
python scripts/validate-spec-structure.py
```

### 1.2 Quality Scoring
Use the spec quality rubric to score across four dimensions:

1. **Completeness (0-25 points)**
   - All required sections present
   - No placeholders or gaps
   - Comprehensive coverage

2. **Clarity (0-25 points)**
   - Unambiguous language
   - Consistent terminology
   - Well-structured content

3. **Implementability (0-25 points)**
   - Technically feasible
   - Resource requirements realistic
   - Dependencies identified

4. **Testability (0-25 points)**
   - Measurable success criteria
   - Clear acceptance scenarios
   - Validation methods defined

### 1.3 Multi-Perspective Review

#### Technical Review
Focus areas:
- Architecture feasibility
- Technology choices
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations
- Integration complexity

#### Business Review
Focus areas:
- Outcome alignment
- User value delivery
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Risk assessment
- Timeline realism

#### Quality Review
Focus areas:
- Testing strategy
- Documentation plan
- Maintenance approach
- Monitoring strategy

### 1.4 Initial Assessment Output
Create `spec-quality-report-v1.md`:
```markdown
# Spec Quality Assessment Report

## Overall Score: XX/100

### Dimension Scores
- Completeness: XX/25
- Clarity: XX/25
- Implementability: XX/25
- Testability: XX/25

### Critical Issues
1. [Issue description, impact, location]
2. [Issue description, impact, location]

### Improvement Recommendations
1. [Recommendation, priority, effort]
2. [Recommendation, priority, effort]
```

**Quality Gate 1**: Target score 70/100 to proceed.
- **Score 70+**: Proceed to Phase 2
- **Score 60-69**: May proceed with:
  - Documented plan to address gaps during implementation
  - Stakeholder acknowledgment of risks
  - Extra review checkpoints planned
- **Score <60**: Requires major revision before proceeding

## Phase 2: Gap Analysis and Prioritization

### 2.1 Issue Categorization

Classify all identified issues:

**Blocking Issues** (Must fix):
- Missing critical requirements
- Ambiguous success criteria
- Unresolved conflicts
- Technical impossibilities

**Major Issues** (Should fix):
- Incomplete sections
- Vague descriptions
- Missing non-functional requirements
- Weak test scenarios

**Minor Issues** (Could fix):
- Formatting inconsistencies
- Redundant content
- Optimization opportunities

### 2.2 Root Cause Analysis

For each blocking/major issue:
1. Identify why it exists
2. Determine information needed
3. Identify stakeholders to involve
4. Estimate resolution effort

### 2.3 Improvement Plan

Create prioritized improvement plan:
```markdown
## Improvement Plan

### Sprint 1 (Blocking Issues) - 2-4 hours
- [ ] Issue 1: [Description] - Owner: [Name]
- [ ] Issue 2: [Description] - Owner: [Name]

### Sprint 2 (Major Issues) - 2-3 hours
- [ ] Issue 3: [Description] - Owner: [Name]
- [ ] Issue 4: [Description] - Owner: [Name]

### Sprint 3 (Minor Issues) - 1-2 hours
- [ ] Issue 5: [Description] - Owner: [Name]
```

## Phase 3: Improvement Implementation

### 3.1 Iterative Improvement Cycles

For each improvement sprint:

1. **Execute Improvements**
   - Update spec content
   - Add missing information
   - Clarify ambiguities
   - Resolve conflicts

2. **Validate Changes**
   - Re-run automated checks
   - Peer review changes
   - Update quality scores

3. **Document Rationale**
   - Why changes were made
   - Sources of new information
   - Decisions and trade-offs

### 3.2 Continuous Quality Tracking

Update quality scores after each sprint:
```
Sprint 0: 72/100 (baseline)
Sprint 1: 85/100 (+13, blocking issues resolved)
Sprint 2: 92/100 (+7, major issues resolved)
Sprint 3: 95/100 (+3, minor improvements)
```

### 3.3 Stakeholder Validation

After major improvements:
- Review changes with stakeholders
- Confirm understanding
- Get explicit approval
- Document agreements

## Phase 4: Final Validation

### 4.1 Comprehensive Review

Perform final review across all dimensions:

**Requirements Validation**
- [ ] All user stories have specs
- [ ] Acceptance criteria measurable
- [ ] Non-functionals quantified
- [ ] Dependencies documented

**Architecture Validation**
- [ ] Components well-defined
- [ ] Interfaces specified
- [ ] Technology justified
- [ ] Scalability addressed

**Quality Validation**
- [ ] Test strategy comprehensive
- [ ] Performance targets set
- [ ] Security reviewed
- [ ] Monitoring planned

**Implementation Validation**
- [ ] Phases identifiable
- [ ] Effort estimable
- [ ] Risks assessed
- [ ] Resources available

### 4.2 Cross-Reference Verification

Verify all cross-references:
- Requirements ↔ Components
- Components ↔ Interfaces
- Decisions ↔ Rationale
- Risks ↔ Mitigations

### 4.3 Final Quality Score

**Quality Gate 2**: Target score 90/100 for approval

**Approval Guidelines**:
- **Score 90+**: Standard approval, proceed to roadmap
- **Score 85-89**: Conditional approval with:
  - Specific gaps documented in risk register
  - Compensating controls identified
  - Priority improvement plan for next iteration
  - Executive sponsor sign-off on residual risk
- **Score 80-84**: Extended approval possible if:
  - Time-critical project with documented urgency
  - Improvement plan addresses gaps in Phase 1
  - Weekly quality reviews during implementation
  - Dedicated quality improvement resource assigned
- **Score <80**: Requires additional improvement cycles

## Phase 5: Sign-off and Documentation

### 5.1 Formal Approval

Obtain sign-offs:
```markdown
## Spec Approval

### Quality Metrics
- Final Score: XX/100
- Iterations: X
- Time Invested: XX hours

### Approvals
- Technical Lead: [Name] - [Date]
- Product Owner: [Name] - [Date]
- Architecture: [Name] - [Date]
- QA Lead: [Name] - [Date]

### Conditions
[Any conditions or caveats]
```

### 5.2 Lessons Learned

Document for future specs:
- What worked well
- Common issues found
- Effective improvements
- Process optimizations

### 5.3 Transition Readiness

Confirm ready for roadmap:
- [ ] Quality score ≥85
- [ ] All blockers resolved
- [ ] Stakeholders aligned
- [ ] Resources committed
- [ ] No unacceptable risks

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Perfection Paralysis**: Don't aim for 100/100
2. **Superficial Reviews**: Dig deep into substance
3. **Solo Review**: Multiple perspectives essential
4. **Skipping Documentation**: Record all decisions
5. **Ignoring Red Flags**: Address concerns early

## Continuous Improvement

Track metrics across projects:
- Average initial scores
- Common issue types
- Improvement effectiveness
- Time investment ROI

Use data to improve:
- Spec templates
- Creation process
- Review efficiency
- Quality standards

## Next Steps

Once spec achieves quality threshold:
1. Archive final version
2. Create roadmap using `2-spec-to-roadmap.md`
3. Begin phase planning
4. Maintain spec as living document
