# Integration Test Suite for Spec-to-Execution Pipeline

## Overview
This document defines integration tests to validate the complete workflow from specification creation through to executable phase plans.

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete Pipeline Flow
**Objective**: Validate end-to-end process works correctly

```markdown
## Test: Full Pipeline Execution

### Setup
1. Create sample project requirements
2. Prepare test templates
3. Set up clean working directory

### Steps
1. **Spec Creation**
   - Input: Requirements document
   - Process: Run spec creation (1-create-spec-v3.md)
   - Expected: SPEC.md with score >85

2. **Spec Review**
   - Input: Generated SPEC.md
   - Process: Run quality review (5-review-improve-spec.md)
   - Expected: Quality report, improvements implemented

3. **Modularization**
   - Input: Reviewed SPEC.md
   - Process: Run modularization (2-spec-to-modules.md)
   - Expected: Modular spec structure created

4. **Roadmap Generation**
   - Input: Modular specs
   - Process: Generate roadmap (2-spec-to-roadmap.md)
   - Expected: ROADMAP.md with phases defined

5. **Phase Planning**
   - Input: ROADMAP.md
   - Process: Create phase plans (3-roadmap-to-phase-plan.md)
   - Expected: WORK_PLAN.md and REVIEW_PLAN.md

6. **Alignment Validation**
   - Input: All generated documents
   - Process: Run alignment validation
   - Expected: No blocking issues

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All documents generated
- [ ] Quality thresholds met
- [ ] Alignment validated
- [ ] No manual intervention required
```

### Scenario 2: Quality Gate Enforcement
**Objective**: Verify quality gates prevent bad specs

```markdown
## Test: Quality Gate Blocking

### Test Cases

1. **Low Quality Spec**
   - Create spec with score <70
   - Attempt to proceed to roadmap
   - Expected: Process blocks with clear error

2. **Missing Requirements**
   - Create spec with gaps
   - Run quality review
   - Expected: Gaps identified, improvement required

3. **Alignment Issues**
   - Create misaligned roadmap
   - Run validation
   - Expected: Issues detected and reported
```

### Scenario 3: Change Propagation
**Objective**: Validate updates flow through pipeline

```markdown
## Test: Requirement Change Impact

### Steps
1. Create complete pipeline
2. Modify requirement in spec
3. Run update process
4. Validate change appears in:
   - Modular specs
   - Roadmap phases
   - Work plans
   - Review criteria
```

TEST_DIR="./test-output"
rm -rf $TEST_DIR
mkdir -p $TEST_DIR

# Test 1: Spec Creation
echo "1. Testing spec creation..."
cp test-data/requirements.md $TEST_DIR/
cd $TEST_DIR
# Run spec creation process
# Validate output

# Test 2: Quality Review
echo "2. Testing quality review..."
# Run quality scoring
# Check score threshold

# Test 3: Modularization
echo "3. Testing modularization..."
# Run modularization
# Verify structure

# Test 4: Roadmap Generation
echo "4. Testing roadmap generation..."
# Generate roadmap
# Validate phases

# Test 5: Phase Planning
echo "5. Testing phase planning..."
# Create plans
# Check alignment

# Summary
echo "=== Test Results ==="
# Report results
```

## Validation Points

### Document Existence
```python
def test_document_creation():
    """Verify all expected documents are created"""
    expected_files = [
        "SPEC.md",
        ".spec/components/",
        ".spec/interfaces/",
        "ROADMAP.md",
        ".plan/phase-1/WORK_PLAN.md",
        ".plan/phase-1/REVIEW_PLAN.md"
    ]
    
    for file in expected_files:
        assert os.path.exists(file), f"Missing: {file}"
```

### Quality Thresholds
```python
def test_quality_scores():
    """Verify quality scores meet thresholds"""
    spec_score = calculate_spec_score("SPEC.md")
    assert spec_score >= 85, f"Spec score too low: {spec_score}"
    
    alignment_score = validate_alignment()
    assert alignment_score >= 95, f"Alignment issues: {alignment_score}%"
```

### Cross-References
```python
def test_cross_references():
    """Verify all cross-references are valid"""
    broken_links = check_all_links()
    assert len(broken_links) == 0, f"Broken links: {broken_links}"
```

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Pipeline Integration Tests

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'spec-building/**'
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements-test.txt
          
      - name: Run integration tests
        run: |
          python -m pytest tests/integration/
          
      - name: Run pipeline test
        run: |
          ./tests/test-pipeline.sh
          
      - name: Upload artifacts
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: test-output
          path: test-output/
```

## Test Metrics

Track these metrics over time:
- Pipeline execution time
- Quality score distribution
- Common failure points
- Manual intervention frequency
- Update propagation accuracy

## Known Issues and Workarounds

1. **Template Version Mismatch**
   - Issue: Old templates cause validation failures
   - Workaround: Version templates, check compatibility

2. **Large Spec Performance**
   - Issue: Processing slows with very large specs
   - Workaround: Increase timeouts, consider chunking

3. **Cross-Reference Loops**
   - Issue: Circular references cause infinite loops
   - Workaround: Add cycle detection to validation

## Next Steps

1. Implement automated test suite
2. Create regression test cases
3. Add performance benchmarks
4. Build test data generator
5. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
