# Logging and Progress Tracking Standards

## Purpose and Importance of Project Logging

Logging is not overhead—it's an investment in project velocity and quality. Proper logging transforms chaotic development into a predictable, learnable process where every challenge becomes documented wisdom for future work.

### Why Logging Matters

1. **Knowledge Preservation**: Every solved problem becomes a reusable solution
2. **Progress Visibility**: Stakeholders see real progress, not just promises
3. **Debugging Efficiency**: Issues traced in minutes, not hours
4. **Learning Acceleration**: Patterns emerge from documented experiences
5. **Onboarding Speed**: New team members learn from recorded decisions
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete history for compliance and review

### The Cost of Not Logging

Without proper logging:
- Problems are solved repeatedly
- Progress is invisible until delivery
- Debugging requires archaeology
- Knowledge leaves with people
- Decisions lack context
- Mistakes repeat endlessly

## What to Log at Each Project Phase

### Project Initialization Phase

```markdown
# Project Initialization Log - [Project Name]
Date: 2024-01-15
Phase: Initialization

## Project Setup
- **Repository created**: https://github.com/org/project
- **Initial structure**: Used template X with modifications
- **Key decisions**:
  - Language: TypeScript (for type safety)
  - Framework: Next.js (for SSR/SSG flexibility)
  - Database: PostgreSQL (for complex queries)
  - Testing: Jest + Playwright (unit + e2e)

## Initial Challenges
- **Challenge**: Conflicting peer dependencies
- **Solution**: Pinned specific versions, documented in package.json
- **Time spent**: 45 minutes
- **Future prevention**: Created dependency update policy

## Environment Configuration
- Development environment setup documented
- Required tools: Node 20+, PostgreSQL 15+, Redis 7+
- Environment variables template created
- Secrets management: Using dotenv + Vault

## Next Steps
1. Implement authentication system
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Create initial database schema
```

### Development Phase

```markdown
# Development Log - 2024-01-16
Sprint: 3
Features: User Authentication, Profile Management

## Morning Session (09:00 - 12:30)

### Completed
- ✅ Implemented JWT authentication middleware
- ✅ Created user registration endpoint
- ✅ Added password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ Set up refresh token rotation

### Code Snippets
```typescript
// Interesting pattern discovered for token refresh
const refreshTokens = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { refreshToken } = req.cookies;
  
  // Validate and rotate tokens
  const payload = await validateRefreshToken(refreshToken);
  const newTokens = await generateTokenPair(payload.userId);
  
  // Invalidate old refresh token
  await invalidateToken(refreshToken);
  
  // Set secure cookies
  setTokenCookies(res, newTokens);
  
  return res.json({ accessToken: newTokens.accessToken });
};
```

### Challenges Encountered
1. **CORS issues with credentials**
   - Problem: Cookies not being sent cross-origin
   - Solution: Set `credentials: 'include'` and proper CORS headers
   - Learning: Document all CORS requirements upfront

2. **Token expiry edge case**
   - Problem: Race condition during token refresh
   - Solution: Implemented token grace period
   - Time lost: 1.5 hours

### Decisions Made
- **ADR-003**: Use HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens
  - Reason: XSS protection
  - Alternative considered: localStorage (rejected due to XSS vulnerability)
  - Impact: Requires CORS configuration for API calls

## Afternoon Session (13:30 - 17:00)

### Focus: Profile Management API

### Progress
- 📊 Velocity: 13 story points completed (target was 10)
- 🐛 Bugs found: 2 (both fixed)
- 🧪 Test coverage: 87% (up from 82%)

### Key Insights
- Learned: Prisma's `@updatedAt` automatically handles timestamps
- Pattern: Use DTOs for API input validation
- Tool discovery: `tsx` for TypeScript script execution

### Tomorrow's Plan
1. Complete profile image upload
2. Implement email verification
3. Add rate limiting to auth endpoints
```

### Testing Phase

```markdown
# Testing Log - 2024-01-20
Phase: Integration Testing
Focus: Authentication Flow

## Test Implementation

### New Test Patterns
```javascript
// Discovered useful pattern for auth testing
describe('Authentication Flow', () => {
  let authCookie: string;
  
  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Reset database to known state
    await resetDb();
    await seedTestUsers();
  });
  
  test('complete authentication flow', async () => {
    // 1. Register
    const registerRes = await request(app)
      .post('/auth/register')
      .send(validUserData);
    
    expect(registerRes.status).toBe(201);
    
    // 2. Login
    const loginRes = await request(app)
      .post('/auth/login')
      .send(credentials);
    
    authCookie = loginRes.headers['set-cookie'];
    
    // 3. Access protected route
    const protectedRes = await request(app)
      .get('/api/profile')
      .set('Cookie', authCookie);
    
    expect(protectedRes.status).toBe(200);
  });
});
```

### Solution Pattern Library

```markdown
# Solution Patterns

## Performance Issues

### Pattern: Slow Database Queries
**Symptoms**: High API latency, database CPU spike
**Common Causes**:
1. Missing indexes
2. N+1 queries
3. Large dataset operations

**Solutions**:
```sql
-- Add appropriate indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_table_column ON table(column);

-- Use query explains
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT ...;

-- Batch operations
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ANY(ARRAY[1,2,3,4,5]);
```

### Pattern: Memory Leaks
**Symptoms**: Gradual memory increase, eventual OOM
**Common Causes**:
1. Event listener accumulation
2. Circular references
3. Cache without expiry

**Solutions**:
```javascript
// Always remove listeners
componentWillUnmount() {
  this.emitter.removeListener('event', this.handler);
}

// Use WeakMap for object caches
const cache = new WeakMap();

// Set cache expiry
cache.set(key, value, { ttl: 300 });
```

## Security Issues

### Pattern: Authentication Bypass
**Symptoms**: Unauthorized access to protected resources
**Common Causes**:
1. Missing middleware
2. Incorrect JWT validation
3. Session fixation

**Solutions**:
```typescript
// Always verify JWT signature
const payload = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);

// Regenerate session on login
req.session.regenerate(() => {
  req.session.userId = user.id;
});

// Use middleware consistently
router.use('/api/*', requireAuth);
```
```

## Task Context Preservation

### Context Switching Log

```markdown
# Context Switch Log
Date: 2024-01-15
Time: 14:30

## Current Task State
**Task**: Implementing user profile API
**Progress**: 70% complete

### Completed
- ✅ GET /profile endpoint
- ✅ PUT /profile endpoint
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Unit tests

### In Progress
- 🚧 Profile image upload (50% done)
  - S3 bucket configured
  - Upload endpoint created
  - TODO: Add image processing

### Next Steps
1. Complete image resizing logic
2. Add file type validation
3. Implement delete old image
4. Write integration tests

### Open Questions
- Should we limit image size? (Current: 5MB)
- Format support: JPEG, PNG only?
- Thumbnail generation: on-upload or on-demand?

### Code State
```bash
# Current branch
git branch: feature/user-profile

# Uncommitted changes
- src/services/imageProcessor.ts (new file)
- src/routes/profile.ts (modified)
- tests/profile.test.ts (modified)

# Last commit
commit 5a8f3d2: Add S3 configuration for profile images
```

### Mental Model
Working on making profile images uploadable. Using S3 for storage,
with a pre-upload validation step. Need to decide on image processing
approach - leaning toward sharp library for resizing.

### Blockers
- Waiting for S3 bucket permissions from DevOps
- Need clarification on image size limits from Product

### Time Spent
- Morning session: 3h (basic endpoints)
- Afternoon so far: 1.5h (image upload)
- Estimated remaining: 2h

## Resume Instructions
1. Pull latest from main (PR #123 was merged)
2. Check S3 permissions (should be ready)
3. Continue with imageProcessor.ts implementation
4. Use sharp library as decided
```

### Handoff Documentation

```markdown
# Task Handoff: User Authentication
From: Alice
To: Bob
Date: 2024-01-16

## Overview
Implementing JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens.
About 80% complete, needs final testing and edge cases.

## Current State

### Completed ✅
- User registration with email validation
- Login with JWT generation
- Refresh token rotation
- Password reset flow
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Unit tests (95% coverage)

### In Progress 🚧
- Email verification implementation (60% done)
  - Email service configured
  - Templates created
  - Need to add queue for sending

### Not Started ❌
- Social login (Google, GitHub)
- Two-factor authentication
- Account lockout after failed attempts

## Key Files
```
src/
├── auth/
│   ├── jwt.service.ts       # JWT handling (complete)
│   ├── auth.controller.ts   # Main endpoints (complete)
│   ├── email.service.ts     # Email sending (in progress)

│   └── rateLimiter.ts      # Rate limiting (complete)
└── models/
    └── user.model.ts       # User schema (complete)
```

## Critical Information

### Environment Variables Needed
```env
JWT_SECRET=<get from vault>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<get from vault>
EMAIL_API_KEY=<get from vault>
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### Known Issues
1. **Refresh token race condition**
   - Occurs when multiple requests with same token
   - Mitigation in place but needs testing
   - See `auth.controller.ts` line 145

2. **Email service timeout**
   - Sometimes times out on first send
   - Retry logic implemented but could be better
   - Consider moving to queue

### Testing Instructions
```bash
# Run all auth tests
npm test auth/

# Test email service manually
npm run script:test-email

# Load test auth endpoints
npm run load-test:auth
```

### Next Steps Priority
1. 🔴 Fix email queue implementation (2-3 hours)
2. 🟡 Add integration tests for full flow (2 hours)
3. 🟡 Handle edge cases (locked accounts) (1 hour)
4. 🟢 Add social login (new feature) (4-6 hours)

### Questions for Product
- How long should refresh tokens live? (Currently 30 days)
- Should we log all auth attempts? (Privacy concern)
- Email verification required or optional?

### Useful Context
- Followed OWASP guidelines for auth
- Refresh tokens in HTTP-only cookies
- Access tokens in memory only (not localStorage)
- Rate limiting: 5 attempts per 15 minutes

### Contact Me If...
- Questions about JWT implementation
- Need help with Passport strategy
- Database schema clarification
- Any security concerns

Good luck! The auth system is solid, just needs the final 20%.

### Example ADR

```markdown
# ADR-004: Use Redis for Session Storage

Status: Accepted
Date: 2024-01-18
Deciders: Alice (Lead), Bob (Backend), Carol (DevOps)
Technical Story: PROJ-123

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to store user sessions in a way that supports horizontal scaling of our API servers. Currently using in-memory storage which doesn't work with multiple instances.

## Decision Drivers

- Horizontal scalability requirement
- Session data is temporary (can be regenerated)
- Sub-100ms access time requirement
- Budget constraints ($500/month max)

## Considered Options

1. Redis (managed service)
2. PostgreSQL session table
3. JWT tokens only (stateless)
4. Sticky sessions with load balancer

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Redis (managed service)", because it provides the best balance of performance, scalability, and operational simplicity within our constraints.

### Positive Consequences

- Seamless horizontal scaling
- Built-in TTL for session expiry
- Fast access times (<5ms typical)
- Managed service reduces operational burden

### Negative Consequences

- Additional infrastructure dependency
- Monthly cost (~$50-100)
- Need to handle Redis downtime gracefully

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Redis (managed service)

**Good:**
- Purpose-built for this use case
- Excellent performance
- Automatic failover
- Built-in data expiration

**Bad:**
- Additional service to manage
- Costs money
- Another potential point of failure

### PostgreSQL session table

**Good:**
- No new infrastructure
- ACID compliance
- Can query sessions

**Bad:**
- Much slower than Redis
- Manual cleanup needed
- Increases database load

### JWT tokens only

**Good:**
- No infrastructure needed
- Truly stateless
- Infinitely scalable

**Bad:**
- Can't revoke tokens
- Larger request payloads
- Complex refresh logic

### Sticky sessions

**Good:**
- Simple to implement
- No code changes

**Bad:**
- Uneven load distribution
- Lost sessions on instance restart
- Complicates deployments

## Links

- [Redis implementation PR #345]
- [Session service documentation]
- [Monitoring dashboard]

## Notes

Migration strategy:
1. Deploy Redis instance
2. Update session middleware to check Redis first
3. Gradually migrate active sessions
4. Remove in-memory fallback after 30 days

Consider revisiting if we move to edge computing where Redis latency might be an issue.
```

## Log Rotation and Maintenance

### Automated Log Rotation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# rotate-logs.sh - Run weekly via cron

LOG_DIR=".logs"
ARCHIVE_DIR=".logs/archive"
RETENTION_DAYS=90

# Create archive directory
mkdir -p "$ARCHIVE_DIR"

## How Logs Support Knowledge Transfer

### Onboarding New Team Members

```markdown
# New Team Member Onboarding Checklist

## Week 1: Learn from Logs
- [ ] Read last month's decision logs (ADRs)
- [ ] Review recent challenge/solution pairs
- [ ] Study the learning journal index
- [ ] Understand velocity trends from metrics

## Suggested Reading Order
1. `.logs/decisions/` - Understand why things are the way they are
2. `.logs/challenges/` - Learn from past problems
3. `.logs/learning/` - Discover tools and techniques
4. `.logs/progress/weekly/` - Get sense of team rhythm

## Key Insights to Extract
- Common problem patterns
- Team's problem-solving approach
- Technology decisions and trade-offs
- Performance expectations
- Quality standards

## Your First Contributions
1. Add a TIL entry for something you learn
2. Document a challenge you encounter
3. Contribute to weekly summary
4. Propose improvement to logging process
```

### Knowledge Base Generation

```markdown
# Auto-Generated Knowledge Base

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Authentication Problems
*Based on 15 logged incidents*

**Symptoms:**
- 401 errors after deployment
- Token expiry during requests
- CORS failures on login

**Root Causes:**
1. Environment variable mismatch (7 cases)
2. Clock skew between servers (4 cases)
3. Incorrect CORS configuration (4 cases)

**Standard Solution:**
```bash
# Check environment variables
./scripts/verify-env.sh

# Sync server time
sudo ntpdate -s time.nist.gov

# Verify CORS settings
curl -I -X OPTIONS https://api.example.com
```

**Prevention:**
- Pre-deployment environment check
- NTP configuration in infrastructure
- CORS configuration in version control

### Performance Degradation
*Based on 8 logged incidents*

**Common Patterns:**
1. Missing database indexes (5 cases)
2. N+1 query problems (2 cases)
3. Memory leaks (1 case)

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. Check slow query log
2. Review recent deployments
3. Analyze memory usage trends
4. Profile API endpoints

**Quick Wins:**
- Add composite indexes
- Implement query result caching
- Use database query explains
```

### Team Learning Patterns

# analyze_team_learning.py
"""Identify team learning patterns from logs"""

def analyze_learning_velocity():
    """Track how quickly team learns new concepts"""
    
    learning_times = {}
    
    # Track time from first encounter to mastery
    # (When it stops appearing in challenges)
    
    for challenge in parse_challenges():
        topic = extract_topic(challenge)
        first_seen = challenge.date
        
        if topic not in learning_times:

            }
        else:

## Conclusion

Effective logging transforms development from a series of forgotten battles into a documented journey of continuous improvement. Key principles:

1. **Log Consistently**: Make it a habit, not an afterthought
2. **Be Specific**: Vague logs help no one, including future you
3. **Track Patterns**: Logs reveal trends humans miss
4. **Share Knowledge**: Your struggle is someone's future timesaver
5. **Automate Analysis**: Let scripts find insights in your logs

Remember: The best time to start logging was at project start. The second best time is now. Your future self (and team) will thank you.
