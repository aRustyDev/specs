# WORK_PLAN.md Narrative Patterns Analysis

## Executive Summary

The WORK_PLAN.md files demonstrate a sophisticated information architecture that combines technical precision with human-centered design. They use progressive disclosure, contextual guidance, and multiple learning pathways to create plans that are both actionable and educational.

## Content Types and Patterns

### 1. Narrative Introductions

#### Section Context Pattern
Each work section begins with a **Work Unit Context** that provides:
```markdown
**Work Unit Context:**
- **Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High] - [Brief explanation]
- **Scope**: Target X-Y lines across N files
- **Key Components**: 
  - Component name (~estimated lines)
  - Component name (~estimated lines)
- **Patterns**: [List of design patterns used]
- **Required Algorithms**: [If applicable]
```

This pattern serves multiple purposes:
- Sets expectations before diving into details
- Helps workers gauge effort required
- Provides architectural overview
- Identifies learning prerequisites

#### Progressive Complexity Disclosure
The plans reveal complexity gradually:
1. Overview statement (1 sentence)
2. Bullet points of key aspects
3. Detailed task breakdowns
4. Code examples with explanations
5. Edge cases and considerations

### 2. Contextual Explanations

#### "Why Before What" Pattern
Each major section explains rationale before implementation:
- Phase goals and business value
- Technical decisions and tradeoffs
- Security implications
- Performance considerations

Example from Phase 4:
```markdown
/// Conservative fallback rules when SpiceDB is unavailable
/// 
/// SECURITY CRITICAL - These rules must be conservative:
/// Allowed:
/// - Health checks (no resource)
/// - Users reading their own resources
/// Denied:
/// - All write operations
/// - Cross-user access
```

#### Inline Education
Technical concepts are explained at point of use:
- üí° **Junior Developer Tips**: Contextual learning resources
- üìö **Resource Links**: Just-in-time documentation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warnings**: Critical information highlighted
- üîí **Security Notes**: Security implications explained

### 3. Task Structure with Guidance

#### Three-Layer Task Pattern
Each task follows this structure:
1. **Task Title**: Clear action statement
2. **Context/Tips**: Educational content or warnings
3. **Implementation**: Concrete code/steps

Example:
```markdown
#### Task 2.2.2: Implement Exponential Backoff with Jitter

üí° **Junior Developer Tip**: Confused about exponential backoff? See [Retry Patterns Guide](../../junior-dev-helper/retry-patterns-guide.md) for visual explanations!

Use the pattern from examples with enhancements:
```rust
// Implementation code
```
```

#### Test-First Narrative
Every section starts with "Write X Tests First" because:
- Reinforces TDD methodology
- Provides concrete success criteria
- Shows expected behavior before implementation
- Reduces ambiguity

### 4. Flow and Readability Patterns

#### Checkpoint Pattern
Regular checkpoints serve as:
- Natural pause points
- Review boundaries
- Progress markers
- Confidence builders

Each checkpoint includes:
- Clear deliverables
- Self-verification checklist
- Commit message template
- Escalation path

#### Breadcrumb Navigation
Multiple navigation aids:
- Quick links at top
- Progress indicators (checkpoints)
- Cross-references to related content
- "Next Phase Preview" for continuity

## Information Architecture

### 1. Content Type Taxonomy

#### Core Information Types
1. **Prerequisites**: Required knowledge/skills
2. **Quick Reference**: Links and resources
3. **Overview**: High-level phase description
4. **Methodology**: Development approach (TDD)
5. **Done Criteria**: Success metrics
6. **Work Breakdown**: Detailed tasks
7. **Code Examples**: Inline implementation samples
8. **Checkpoints**: Review boundaries
9. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues/solutions
10. **Learning Paths**: Educational progressions

#### Supporting Information Types
1. **Tips/Warnings**: Contextual guidance
2. **Security Notes**: Critical requirements
3. **Performance Targets**: Measurable goals
4. **Recovery Strategies**: Fallback approaches
5. **Documentation Requirements**: What to capture
6. **Test Patterns**: Testing strategies
7. **Verification Scripts**: Automated checks
8. **Common Errors**: Antipattern prevention

### 2. Information Layering

#### Layer 1: Orientation (Prerequisites, Overview)
- Answers: "Am I ready for this?"
- Provides: Context and preparation

#### Layer 2: Planning (Done Criteria, Work Breakdown)
- Answers: "What am I building?"
- Provides: Goals and structure

#### Layer 3: Implementation (Tasks, Code Examples)
- Answers: "How do I build it?"
- Provides: Concrete steps

#### Layer 4: Verification (Tests, Checkpoints)
- Answers: "Did I build it right?"
- Provides: Quality assurance

#### Layer 5: Support (Troubleshooting, Learning Paths)
- Answers: "What if I get stuck?"
- Provides: Help and education

### 3. Contextual Bridges

#### Temporal Bridges
- "Before starting Phase X, ensure you have..."
- "Once all checkpoints pass..."
- "Next Phase Preview"

#### Conceptual Bridges
- Links to prerequisite knowledge
- References to previous phases
- Callbacks to established patterns

#### Skill-Level Bridges
- Main path for experienced developers
- Junior Developer sidebars
- Multiple explanation depths

## Effective Narrative Patterns

### 1. The "Guided Journey" Pattern
Each phase is a complete journey:
- **Departure**: Prerequisites and preparation
- **Adventure**: Tasks and challenges
- **Return**: Verification and completion

### 2. The "Safety Net" Pattern
Multiple fallback mechanisms:
- Alternative approaches documented
- Recovery strategies provided
- Escalation paths clear
- "If stuck" guidance

### 3. The "Progressive Disclosure" Pattern
Information revealed as needed:
```
Overview ‚Üí Context ‚Üí Details ‚Üí Examples ‚Üí Edge Cases
```

### 4. The "Multiple Pathways" Pattern
Different routes for different readers:
- Fast path for experts
- Guided path for juniors
- Reference path for debugging

### 5. The "Checkpoint Ritual" Pattern
Standardized checkpoint process:
1. Complete tasks
2. Self-verify
3. Clean up
4. Commit
5. Document questions
6. Wait for review
