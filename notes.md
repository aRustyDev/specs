  Phase Work Prompts (for Sonnet):

  - Phase 1: Fix compilation errors and implement validation
  - Phase 2: Implement file-based persistence
  - Phase 3: Make all CLI commands functional
  - Phase 4: Build the Terminal User Interface
  - Phase 5: Implement advanced features (auto-detection, 1Password, GPG)
  - Phase 6: Achieve 100% SPEC compliance

  Phase Review Prompts (for Opus):

  Each phase has specific review points where the senior developer checks:
  - TDD compliance (tests written before implementation)
  - SPEC adherence (exact algorithms, commands, formats)
  - Security practices (no hardcoded secrets, proper permissions)
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Integration testing

  The prompts enforce strict requirements:
  - No escape hatches or vague instructions
  - Mandatory evidence at checkpoints
  - Specific test names and implementation order
  - Exact command formats from the SPEC
  - Clear pass/fail criteria for reviews
